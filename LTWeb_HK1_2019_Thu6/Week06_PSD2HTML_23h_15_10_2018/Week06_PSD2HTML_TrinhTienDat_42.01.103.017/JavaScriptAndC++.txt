- JavaScript files have the file extension .js.
- For testing purposes, it is convenient to use document.write()
- Ending statements with semicolon (;) is not required, but highly recommended.
- Use 'var' to declares a variable.
- Strings are text, written within double quotes (" and ") or single quotes (' and ')
- Names can contain dollar sign ($)
- JavaScript variables can hold many data types: numbers, strings, objects and more
- When adding a number and a string, JavaScript will treat the number as a string.
- A JavaScript function is defined with the 'function' keyword
- You can access object properties in two ways:
	objectName.propertyName
		or
	objectName["propertyName"]
- JavaScript will try to convert strings to numbers in all numeric operations.
	example: 	var x = "100";
		var y = "10";
		var z = x / y;       // z will be 10
- JavaScript interprets numeric constants as hexadecimal if they are preceded by 0x.
- Methods and properties are also available to primitive values, 
because JavaScript treats primitive values as objects when executing methods and properties.
- Syntax creating an array: var array_name = [item1, item2, ...];
- Operator === means: equal value and equal type
- Operator !== means: not equal value or not equal type
- The For Loop: you can omit statement 1 (like when your values are set before the loop starts),
Statement 3 can also be omitted (like when you increment your values inside the loop)
- The JavaScript for/in statement loops through the properties of an object
- When JavaScript tries to operate on a "wrong" data type, it will try to convert the value to a "right" type.
- In JavaScript, objects and functions are also variables.
